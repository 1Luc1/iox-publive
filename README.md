# openhapp

openhapp is a public database of happenings (theatre, cinema, music, presentations, ...) It can connect with other openhapps and sync their content.

openhapp is implemented in ruby, so it can be attached as a rails engine into a rails app serving a theatre's website providing the theatre with all required forms and models to maintain their events in a very easy way. All events which have been published to the world, can then be synced from any other server either by using their API key or bey just granting all sync read operations. It is even possible to allow write operations from specified servers.
